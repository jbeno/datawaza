Datawaza: A Python package for streamlined data science workflows.

Datawaza provides a collection of modules designed to simplify data
exploration, cleaning, modeling, and visualization tasks. It leverages
common data science libraries to offer a higher-level API for common
data science operations, making it easier to perform complex analyses.

Modules:
    - :mod:`datawaza.explore`: Tools for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
    - :mod:`datawaza.clean`: Functions for data cleaning and preprocessing.
    - :mod:`datawaza.model`: Utilities for model training, evaluation, and iteration.
    - :mod:`datawaza.tools`: Miscellaneous helper functions and utilities.
