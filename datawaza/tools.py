    Check for duplicate items (ex: column names) across multiple lists.

    This function takes an arbitrary number of lists and checks for duplicate items
    across the lists, as well as items appearing more than once within each list.
    It prints a summary of the items and the lists they appear in. Additionally, if
    a DataFrame is provided, it checks for any columns in the DataFrame that are
    missing from the lists and prints them.

    Use this function when you are organizing columns in a large DataFrame into
    lists that represent their variable type (ex: num_columns, cat_columns). This
    helps to ensure you haven't duplicated a column accidentally. And the optional
    DataFrame check helps you identify columns that haven't been assigned to a list
    yet. This is really useful when you're dealing with a large dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *lists : List[str]
        An arbitrary number of lists containing items (ex: column names) to check
        for duplicates.
    df : pd.DataFrame, optional
        A DataFrame to check for missing columns that are not present in the lists.
        Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The function prints the duplicate items, the lists they appear in, and any
        missing columns in the DataFrame (if provided).

    Examples
    --------
    Prepare data for examples, with intentional duplicates:

    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'age': [], 'height': [], 'weight': [], 'gender': [],
    ... 'city': [], 'country': []})
    >>> num_cols = ['age', 'height', 'weight']
    >>> cat_cols = ['gender', 'age', 'country', 'country']

    Example 1: Check for duplicate column names in two lists:

    >>> check_for_duplicates(num_cols, cat_cols)
    Items appearing in more than one list, or more than once per list:
    age (2): num_cols, cat_cols
    country (2): cat_cols, cat_cols

    Fix the duplicate column:

    >>> cat_cols = ['gender', 'country']

    Example 2: Check for duplicates, and look for missing columns in a DataFrame:

    >>> check_for_duplicates(num_cols, cat_cols, df=df)
    Items appearing in more than one list, or more than once per list:
    None.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Columns in the dataframe missing from the lists:
    city

    Fix the missing column:

    >>> cat_cols = ['gender', 'city', 'country']

    Final check:

    >>> check_for_duplicates(num_cols, cat_cols, df=df)
    Items appearing in more than one list, or more than once per list:
    None.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Columns in the dataframe missing from the lists:
    None.
