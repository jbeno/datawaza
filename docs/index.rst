Datawaza documentation
====================================
Datawaza is a collection of tools for data exploration, visualization, data cleaning, pipeline creation, model iteration, and evaluation. It builds upon core libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

The functions in this library were originally created while pursuing a Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence from U.C. Berkeley.
